<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I have each of you listed as registrants for the Research Mentor Training course that starts this Friday. I’m looking forward to a great discussion with all of you, and I hope most of you can make it to our first class on Friday. <strong>Please let me know ahead of time if you expect to be out.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve attached the syllabus for this year’s course, which was developed by OITE. They have generously shared their materials so that we can hold the course at NIEHS. I’ve also attached the slides from the first class to give you an idea of what will be covered/discussed.</p>
<p>In preparation for Friday’s discussion, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read <strong>Chapter 1-What is a Mentor?</strong> (can be found in the hyperlink under ‘Readings’ for the May 3 class on the syllabus and also attached as a PDF)</li>
<li>Start to think about and/or <strong>write a brief draft</strong> (can be only a single paragraph) <strong>of your mentoring philosophy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>See you all on Friday! Please let me know if you have any questions ahead of time.</p>
