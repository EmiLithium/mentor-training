<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>It has been great discussing mentorship with you these past few weeks! Unfortunately I will not be there this Friday, but you have a great leader in Katy Hamilton who will be facilitating this next-to-last class. I have attached the semi-final slide set for Friday (Class 3), but please note that these may be modified somewhat ahead of Friday’s class. I also attached the slides from the previous class (class 2), which have been updated with some new hyperlinks.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the <strong>homework from last week (due THURSDAY, May 30  at NOON; email to: <a href="mailto:x@nih.gov">x@nih.gov</a> &amp; <a href="mailto:x@nih.gov">x@nih.gov</a> is to</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discuss ethics and truthfulness in research practices (what do they know about scientific ethics, why is it important, and perhaps share a case study) and write a summary paragraph of your discussion [if you don’t have a mentee, discuss with the youngest member of your group]</li>
<li>Write a paragraph reflecting on how you and your mentee differ, and how these differences could impact your relationship [if you don’t have a mentee, reflect on how you and your MENTOR (or PAST MENTEE) differ]</li>
<li>Read ‘Nature’s guide for Mentors (<strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/447791a.pdf">https://www.nature.com/articles/447791a.pdf</a></strong>) &amp; ‘Mentoring Learned, not Taught’ (<strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwYHd8BliGc0N2pOYkhBXzFSVlk/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwYHd8BliGc0N2pOYkhBXzFSVlk/view</a></strong>).</li>
