<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the discussion with you two weeks ago. Thanks for your participation! I look forward to another great discussion this Friday as well. Please see the reminder for the homework that is due by <strong>MAY 16 AT NOON (please email your assignments to me).</strong> We will exchange mentoring philosophies and student projects, so these assignments will form the basis of our initial class discussion.</p>
<p><strong>As a reminder, the last class assignments were to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write a paragraph describing your mentoring philosophy</li>
<li>Write a paragraph describing your mentee’s project (what expectations do you have, what communications tools can/should you use?)</li>
<li>List 10 phrases (both positive &amp; negative) heard from advisors that impacted you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Friday, please read:</strong> Benefits &amp; Challenges of Diversity (see link in your syllabus or find it here: <a href="https://wiseli.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/662/2018/11/Benefits_Challenges.pdf">https://wiseli.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/662/2018/11/Benefits_Challenges.pdf</a> ).</p>
<p>See you Friday at 12:00pm in Rodbell A!</p>
