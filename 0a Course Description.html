<dd>Are you interested in learning how to become a more effective mentor? Do you wonder how to effectively set expectations of your mentee, and how to best communicate with them? Do you want to learn how to give more meaningful, effective feedback?</dd>
<dd>If you answered ‘YES’ to any of these questions, please join us in May and June for an informal, highly interactive &amp; discussion-based course developed by OITE (see attached syllabus).</dd>
