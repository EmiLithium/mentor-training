<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting with you again this Friday for our last class! As a reminder, <strong>please email your assignments to me by NOON this Thursday.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Homework:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>(Reflection only, no write-up needed).</strong> Reflect on how you and your mentee (OR MENTOR) communicate, and how you can improve that over the remainder of the summer (or year).</li>
<li><strong>(Write-up &amp; send in)</strong> Present one of your mentoring challenges to your PI (or another you respect as a mentor) and ask how they would handle the situation. Submit a summary of their response and what you thought about it.</li>
<li><strong>(Fill out &amp; send in)</strong> Nature’s Guide for Mentors (the last page of: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/447791a.pdf">https://www.nature.com/articles/447791a.pdf</a> (page 7/797))</li>
<li>Reflect on how your mentoring philosophy has changed this summer. For Friday, <strong>bring your original philosophy, OR one that you REWROTE (no need to send to me—just bring on Friday)</strong>, and come prepared to discuss it.</li>
