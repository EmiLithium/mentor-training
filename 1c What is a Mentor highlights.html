<blockquote>
<p>A mentoring relationship develops over an extended period, during which a student’s needs and the nature of the relationship tend to change. A mentor will try to be aware of these changes and vary the degree and type of attention, help, advice, information, and encouragement that he or she provides.</p>
<p>In the broad sense intended here, <mark>a mentor is someone who takes a special interest in helping another person develop into a successful</mark> professional.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Council of Graduate Schools (1995) cites Morris Zelditch’s useful summary of a mentor’s multiple roles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mentors are <mark>advisors, people with career experience</mark> willing to share their knowledge; <mark>supporters, people who give emotional and moral encouragement</mark>; <mark>tutors, people who give specific feedback</mark> on one’s performance; masters, in the sense of employers to whom one is apprenticed; <mark>sponsors, sources of information about and aid in obtaining opportunities</mark>; <mark>models, of identity</mark>, of the kind of person one should be to be an academic.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>A mentor…</dt>
<dd>… has more career experience and can advise and share knowledge</dd>
<dd>… gives emotional and moral encouragement</dd>
<dd>… gives specific feedback on performance</dd>
<dd>… aids in obtaining opportunities</dd>
<dd>… is a role model</dd>
<dd>… is a good listener, observer, and problem-solver</dd>
<dd>… <mark>makes an effort to know, accept, and respect the goals and interests of a student</mark></dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, they <mark>establish an environment in which the student’s accomplishment is limited only by the extent of his or her talent</mark>.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Reasons to mentor</dt>
<dd>having a student succeed and eventually become a friend and colleague is great</dd>
<dd><mark>the best mentors are most likely to recruit and keep students of high caliber</mark> that can help produce better research, papers, and grant proposals</dd>
<dd>keep sharp and stay on top of your field by coaching junior colleagues</dd>
<dd>in making contacts for students, you strengthen your own contacts and make new ones</dd>
<dd>the results of good mentoring live after you</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <em><strong>common goal: to advance the educational and personal growth of the student.</strong></em> The mentor can benefit enormously along the way, but the shared goal is focused on the success of the student.</p>
<p>Mentoring does not need to take a lot of time. A perceptive mentor can provide a lot of help by asking the right question.</p>
<p>I really liked this summary of key practices so I copied almost the entire thing mostly verbatim:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Careful listening.</strong> Pay attention to the “subtext” and undertones of the student’s words, including tone, attitude, and body language. When you think you have understood a point, it might be helpful to repeat it to the student and ask whether you have understood correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Keeping in touch.</strong> A student who is doing well may require only “check-ins” or brief meetings. Another student might have continuing difficulties and require several formal meetings a week; one or two students might occupy most of an adviser’s mentoring time. Try to keep all your students on the “radar” through regular contact (daily, if possible) to anticipate problems before they become serious. Don’t assume that the only students who need help are those who ask for it. Even a student who is doing well could need an occasional, serious conversation. One way to increase your awareness of important student issues and develop rapport is to work with student organizations and initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple mentors.</strong> No mentor can know everything a given student might need in order to succeed. <em>Everyone benefits from multiple mentors</em> of diverse talents, ages, and personalities. No one benefits with a mentor is too “possessive” of a student.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Professional ethics</strong> seems to be key for being a role model in identity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earlier that students are exposed to the notion of scientific integrity, the better prepared they will be to deal with ethical questions that arise in their own work.</p>
<p>Discuss your policies on grades, conflicts of interest, authorship credits, and who goes to meetings. Use real-life questions to help the student understand what is meant by scientific misconduct: What would you do if I asked you to cut corners in your work? What would you do if you had a boss who was unethical?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Advice for new mentors:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Listen patiently. Give the student time</mark> to get to issues they find sensitive or embarrassing.</li>
<li>Build a relationship. Informal conversations, attending lectures together. Take cues as to how close they wish this relationship to be.</li>
<li>Don’t abuse your authority. Don’t ask students to do personal work, such as baby-sitting and typing.</li>
<li>Nurture self-sufficiency. The goal is not to “clone” yourself but to encourage confidence and independent thinking.</li>
<li>Establish “protected time” together. Minimize interruptions from telephone calls or visitors.</li>
<li><mark>Share yourself. Tell of your own successes and failures.</mark> Let the student see your human side.</li>
<li>Provide introductions.</li>
<li>Be constructive. Critical feedback spurs improvement but do it kindly and temper criticism with praise when deserved.</li>
<li>Don’t be overbearing. Avoid dictating choices.</li>
<li>Find your own mentors. New advisers benefit from guidance by those with more experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cultural issues.</strong> Demonstrate your willingness to communicate with and to understand each student as a unique individual. Are you baffled by a student’s behavior? Remember that a cultural difference could be the reason. Finding role models is especially important for students from a culture other than yours.</p>
<p><strong>Disability issues.</strong> Persons with disabilities can function at the same level as other students, but they might need assistance to do so. You can play a pivotal role in finding that assistance, assuring students that they are entitled to that assistance, and confirming that they are able to secure assistance. You can also help make colleagues comfortable with students with disabilities.</p>

<h2 id="extra-notes-on-example-mentoring-philosophies-i-found">Extra notes on example mentoring philosophies I found</h2>
<p>I found this <a href="%5Bhttps://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/Images/Ohland_Mentoring_Philosophy_Statement.pdf%5D(https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/Images/Ohland_Mentoring_Philosophy_Statement.pdf)">this</a> (accessed May 3, 2019) was a well-organized statement I would have loved to receive as a student. I found other statements as well that were total crap—completely missed the point, talked only about themselves or used such prosaic language I hit the <em>snozz</em> button in my brain. I really like Matthew Ohland’s because it’s written for the benefit of the student’s point of view and is written plainly, not presumptuously. It doesn’t seek to elevate himself as the mentor, but to create a level ground on which anyone can approach him about anything they were concerned about.</p>
<p><a href="%5Bhttps://scholardevelopment.okstate.edu/sites/default/files/Mentoring%20Workshop%20Series%20-%20CEAT%20-%20Session%203%20-%20Handouts_Part3.pdf%5D(https://scholardevelopment.okstate.edu/sites/default/files/Mentoring%20Workshop%20Series%20-%20CEAT%20-%20Session%203%20-%20Handouts_Part3.pdf)">This site</a> (accessed May 3, 2019) says, “If you were <mark>giving advice to a fellow researcher on how to be an effective mentor, what would you tell that person?</mark> If they ask how to do each item you mention, what would you say? Your answer would form the foundation of your ‘mentoring philosophy.’” This approach somewhat helps with the mental block of being more comfortable talking with colleagues than with new students.</p>
<p>Even better, <a href="%5Bhttps://academicaffairs.iupui.edu/media/AAContent/Mentoring-Academy/mentoring-philosophy-exercise.pdf%5D(https://academicaffairs.iupui.edu/media/AAContent/Mentoring-Academy/mentoring-philosophy-exercise.pdf)">this site</a> (accessed May 3, 2019) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mentoring philosophy can help you throughout the phases of the mentoring relationship, but particularly in the early phase of establishing a clear purpose and goals. Your mentoring philosophy is a statement that <mark>explains the way you approach mentoring relationships, including identifying why you mentoring and articulating your goals, wants, and needs</mark> in the context of the mentoring relationship. Mentoring philosophies commonly address how you would do the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify mentee goals</li>
<li>Identify what motivates the mentee</li>
<li>Develop a relationship founded on mutual respect</li>
<li>Create a safe environment in which honesty and free exchange of feedback can occur</li>
<li>Instill ownership of goals/projects in the mentee</li>
<li>Share your own experience</li>
<li>Evaluate the mentee’s learning</li>
<li>Evaluate the effectiveness of the relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>Your mentoring philosophy explains how you approach mentoring relationships and should help guide both you and your mentee through the mentoring relationship.</p>
